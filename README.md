## Node.js

## Solidity
* Here is the Solidity [coding style][15]
* Smart contract [best practices][16], tools, engineering tips and other

## Testing

* Aim for 70% plus test coverage levels
* Integration tests are more valuable than unit tests
* Integrate tests with CI and run on each commit

## Continuous Integration

* [Use Travis CI][6]

## Packaging
